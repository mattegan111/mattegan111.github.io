                    <p class="p-line-break">  
                        While doing group work at Uni, I was in a group composed of myself, another student, and two best friends. The best friends were solid straight A students, the rest of us were not.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-line-break">  
                        The best friends ended up re-doing our work to get it to the standard they wanted. By the time I was aware of the group dynamic, the work was done and our work was submitted. The best friends got their A, and the rest of us knew they’d lifted us up.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-line-break">  
                        My regret is that I would’ve liked to consider the level of work the group wanted to achieve and make an effort to get my contribution to that level. Then if more work or revision was needed, maybe seek help from the group in the form of feedback or examples from their own work, or from the lecturer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-line-break">  
                        I also could’ve asked the excellent best-friend duo for a chance to revise my work before they had to redo it themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-line-break">  
                        Communicating standards and expectations in a respectful productive way is a significant challenge especially when different students are at different stages of their learning journey.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-line-break">  
                        My hope is that during this course I will be able to contribute work to a level that I can be proud of and that I can help others work to a level that they can be proud of.
