                    <p class="p-line-break p-bold">
                        What is Emotional Intelligence?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emotional intelligence (or EQ) is an individual's ability to predict, perceive, identify and manage the emotions of themselves and of others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are 5 categories of Emotional Intelligence:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Self-regulation: the ability to manage one&rsquo;s emotional state, and to adapt to change. This skill is used when managing conflict and taking responsibility for one's self.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Motivation: the ability to self-motivate, focussing on internal or self-gratification rather than external praise or reward. This helps one to stick to their goals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Empathy: the ability to recognize and understand how others are feeling and consider those feelings before responding in social situations. Empathy also allows an individual to understand the dynamics that influence their personal and professional relationships.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Social skills: the ability to affect the emotions of others through emotional understanding and using this to build rapport and connect with people through skills such as active listening, verbal and nonverbal communication.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Self-awareness: the ability to recognize and understand oneâ€™s own emotions and their impact on others.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="p-line-break p-bold">
                        How is EQ different from IQ? 
                    </p>
                    <p>Essentially, EQ is to emotions and managing relationships as IQ is to information processing and abstract problem solving.</p>
                    <p>Both EQ and IQ are measures of a person's capabilities, however IQ is considered innate or fixed whereas EQ is able to be improved.</p>
                    <p>Any person may be more or less skilled across the different dimensions of emotional intelligence, but it is possible to improve one's skill level across each category. A commitment to improve is the only prerequisite and there are various practices which may lead to an increased EQ.</p>

                    <p class="p-line-break p-bold">
                        Why is Emotional Intelligence important?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As individuals we can improve our ability to self-manage. If we have a greater self-awareness, we can monitor our emotional state and make wise decisions about how to care for ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a programmer looking to collaborate effectively with others, using my EQ will be just as important as my technical skills when working in a team. Understanding what others are experiencing, feeling and thinking is a prerequisite for effective collaboration and highly valuable when navigating interpersonal conflict.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some purport that EQ has strong predictive value for financial and social success later in life, and while the evidence is not conclusive, it stands to reason that being able to succeed socially is beneficial in all aspects of life, and having a positive relationship with oneself underpins the happiness we experience wherever life takes us.
