                    <p class="p-bold">Neuroplasticity</p>
                    <p>
                        Neuroplasticity is an attribute of the brain that allows us to change the brain through deliberate action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previously we believed that pathways in the brain were formed as we grow from a child into an adult and that these pathways could not be changed thereafter. While the former is true, it turns out that even as an adult, we are able to re-write these pathways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that the brain can be changed has far reaching implications for rehabilitation, addictive behaviour, mental health and learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Changes in the brain are happening all the time. To deliberately influence the changes that are happening, such as, we are trying to become proficient in a new skill, the vehicle we use is focus. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Focus is the lever that gives us input into the changes that happen within our brains. Therefore, changing our minds effectively becomes a question of focussing effectively.
                    </p>

                        Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Andrew Huberman's 1.5 hour podcast about neuroplasticity goes into great detail about the mechanisms behind neuroplasticity but arrives ultimately at the following actionable steps to improve focus:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The real change to the brain occurs as a result of deliberate focus.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Deep sleep is when learning is committed to long-term memory, so sleep well.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Word-less activities like going for a walk are good activities to follow your periods of learning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There are times of the day where you may find you concentrate better - capitalise on them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make a deliberate effort to focus over increasingly long periods of time up to 90 mins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don't expect to be focused at all times.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="p-bold">Growth Mindset</p>
                    <p>A belief that is shared across cultures, yet expressed in different ways, is that what we believe in our minds may help or hinder the results we see in our lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many beliefs point to something other than the self, like Dao in Chinese culture or mana in Maori culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>The common thread seems to be that ‘the self’ is not where it’s at… the ‘self’ may even get in the way.</p>
                    <p>Today, science could perhaps be catching up to the cumulative hunches of humankind, with a new area of research, “growth mindset”, demonstrating objectively the power of believing we can improve, rather than defaulting to self-concious and judgemental thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Experiments have demonstrated that learners who framed an inability or failure to achieve something as a transient challenge rather than a reflection of a personal shortcoming, were more engaged in their learning and more motivated to overcome their challenge. Their outcomes were greater than those who didn’t believe this - those students would have what can be called a ‘fixed mindset’.</p>
                    <p>The implications of this are that self-awareness is of great importance - we can catch any negative, judgemental self-talk and direct our energies back into our learning.</p>
                    <p>Increasing our self-awareness is possible with mindfulness practices - taking time to meditate and to reflect, so we can monitor our thoughts.</p>
