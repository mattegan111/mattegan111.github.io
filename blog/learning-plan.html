                    <p class="p-bold">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
                    <p>This remains unchanged! I’d like to work in a sophisticated team with senior engineers, testers, product owners and a scrum master, using modern tech and modern project management methodologies. My 5 year goal is to be a senior engineer with a backend focus.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</p>
                    <p>My strengths will be both my existing technical. I've worked with React and Node.js before and hope to extend my human skills by collaborating heavily with as many people as I can.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p>
                    <p>I'd like to be generous with my time and energy to those who I can help, and I see this as a challenge because, as I've found from working in tech support, anticipating what others are thinking and composing oneself to respond in an effective way, while also problem solving the task at hand, can be quite exhausting!</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
                    <p>This remains largely unchanged! How to inspire others to do their best work. How to work effectively with others in a team of diverse identities, cultures, value systems and minds.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I'm becoming increasingly reflective on how I spend my energy, and how to be effective in this regard. There's lots of information out there to help with productivity and fitness and lifestyle but I believe this is a personal kind of journey.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>
                    <p>What I'd actually really love is some help or guidance with how to teach others effectively (where my existing knowledge allows!), and also lots of stretch goals to keep me super busy.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
                    <p>My expectation is just that I set realistic and meaningful goals throughout, and celebrate my successes.</p>

                    <p class="p-bold">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
                    <p>I’d like to work in a sophisticated team with senior engineers, testers, product owners and a scrum master, using modern tech and modern project management methodologies. My 5 year goal is to be a senior engineer with a backend focus.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
                    <p>I much prefer real practical projects where I can be given a problem and decide on the best course of action to solve it, then take responsibility for the outcomes. I like making value based judgements and using the right tool for the job, rather than being fixated or passionate about any specific tool. Sometimes I get annoyed with ‘mock’ projects where I don’t know which way ‘true north’ is because I don’t have a realistic brief for how my solution should work. Having a curriculum to follow and a team to work with will help with this.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
                    <p>How to inspire others to do their best work. How to work effectively with others in a team of diverse identities, cultures, value systems and minds.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some people are built different, like Atlas who was able to carry the world upon his shoulders. For the rest of us mere mortals, we must prioritise the things in life that sap our time, energy and resources, so our finite energies get spent in the right place and so we can avoid getting burnt out. For me, I’m lucky that I can make EDA my priority for the next few months, with no other serious commitments.</p>
                    <p>My commitment is that I will pay attention to what others require of me and meet those requirements. If I feel like I’m struggling I will communicate that to both those that may be affected (such as team members) and those who can help me (such as team members, course facilitators, or for personal support, friends and family).</p>
                    <p>My expectation of the facilitation team is that they will be knowledgeable, responsive, supportive and empathetic so my team and I can learn and work as effectively as possible.</p>
                    <p>Finally, regarding schedules, I have no commitments but would just like to have meetings planned out in advance wherever possible so I can get into a rhythm that suits both myself and those around me.</p>
