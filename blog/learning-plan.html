                    </div>
                    <p class="p-bold">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
                    <p>I’d like to work in a sophisticated team with senior engineers, testers, product owners and a scrum master, using modern tech and modern project management methodologies. My 5 year goal is to be a senior engineer with a backend focus.</p>
                    <img src="../images/blog-images/planning-wide.jpg" class="image-size">
                    <p class="p-bold">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
                    <p>I much prefer real practical projects where I can be given a problem and decide on the best course of action to solve it, then take responsibility for the outcomes. I like making value based judgements and using the right tool for the job, rather than being fixated or passionate about any specific tool. Sometimes I get annoyed with ‘mock’ projects where I don’t know which way ‘true north’ is because I don’t have a realistic brief for how my solution should work. Having a curriculum to follow and a team to work with will help with this.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
                    <p>How to inspire others to do their best work. How to work effectively with others in a team of diverse identities, cultures, value systems and minds.</p>
                    <p class="p-bold">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p>
                    <p>Some people are built different, like Atlas who was able to carry the world upon his shoulders. For the rest of us mere mortals, we must prioritise the things in life that sap our time, energy and resources, so our finite energies get spent in the right place and so we can avoid getting burnt out. For me, I’m lucky that I can make EDA my priority for the next few months, with no other serious commitments.</p>
                    <p>My commitment is that I will pay attention to what others require of me and meet those requirements. If I feel like I’m struggling I will communicate that to both those that may be affected (such as team members) and those who can help me (such as team members, course facilitators, or for personal support, friends and family).</p>
                    <p>My expectation of the facilitation team is that they will be knowledgeable, responsive, supportive and empathetic so my team and I can learn and work as effectively as possible.</p>
                    <p>Finally, regarding schedules, I have no commitments but would just like to have meetings planned out in advance wherever possible so I can get into a rhythm that suits both myself and those around me.</p>
